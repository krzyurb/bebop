 * If a client connection emits an 'error' event, it will be forwarded here.

 * For example, one may wish to more gracefully close the socket with a custom HTTP response
 * instead of abruptly severing the connection.
 * Default behavior is to try close the socket with a HTTP '400 Bad Request',
 * or a HTTP '431 Request Header Fields Too Large' in the case of a HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW error.
 * If the socket is not writable it is immediately destroyed.
